# How to contribute to the NHS Wales API Catalogue

We welcome contributions to improve the catalogue, which could be to:

- correct inaccuracies, grammar and typos.
- add a new API to the catalogue.
- suggest an improvement in the catalogue structure.

You can either open an [issue](https://github.com/nwisbeta/api-catalogue/issues) or edit the files and send a [pull request](https://github.com/nwisbeta/api-catalogue/pulls) - but first check that there's not one already open for the same thing.


## Editing files and sending a pull request
To send us a pull request, first fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.

We recommend editing the files using [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [**YAML extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).  You will then get intellisense if you add or edit the api.yml and system.yml files.

Make sure you read the guidance in the [README](https://github.com/nwisbeta/api-catalogue/README.md), to be clear on the content and writing style expected for each file.

Pull requests will be automatically checked for correct file structure and then be reviewed by a member of the @nwis/ecosystem team before merging.
